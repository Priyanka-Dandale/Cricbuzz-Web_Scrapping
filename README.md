# Cricbuzz-Web_Scrapping
Cricbuzz Live Match Commentary Web Scraping


This project is a Python-based web scraping solution that extracts live match commentary from Cricbuzz, one of the most popular cricket websites. The script uses BeautifulSoup and requests libraries to dynamically capture and parse real-time commentary data, which can be further used for analytics, sentiment analysis, or fan engagement tools.
